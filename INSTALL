Building

It is suggested that you build this source code in a separate directory. Here 
are some instructions:

the $ part of the command -- note that if you are using a different shell you
may see a % instead of $. That is fine, the instructions should still work).

	$ sh bootstrap.sh
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ ../configure --prefix=`pwd`/installed
	$ make
	$ make install

You should now have the bls binary located in build/installed/bin/

## NOTE ##
Using "--prefix=`pwd`/installed" will allow you to "make install" the binary
in a directory called "installed" within your local "build" directory. If you would 
like to install the binary in /usr/local/bin then do not include the prefix (and you
will have to invoke 'sudo'). Alternatively you can install the binary in a different 
directory by indicating it with the --prefix option
