FossilGen
=========

This program simulates phylogenies and fossil occurance times under the 
serial-sampled birth-death process of Stadler (J. Ther. Biol, 2010).

Complete trees are generated under a constant-rate birth-death process using the 
generalized sampling approach (Hartmann, Wong, & Stadler Syst. Biol. 2010; Stadler Syst. Biol. 2011).
Then, fossilization events are simulated according to a Poisson process with rate parameter \psi.
